If a gap, jump if safe

Part b
======
If a gap, jump if safe and can continue
and( D, not(A and B and C))
doesn't work for 
#####.#.#...#####
    @ABCDEFGHI
as we jump over the first gap and can't continue
so only jump if either next jump works so -> D -> H ie H True
or we can move after the first jump so -> D->E->F or D->E->I ie E and then either F or I are True


NOT J T
OR J T   # T is now True, J or (not J)

NOT T J  # J False
OR I J  # J = I
OR F J  # J = F or I
AND E J  # J = E and (F or I) If we land on E, we can either walk on or jump

OR H J   # J = H or (E and I)


AND A T  # T = A
AND B T  # T = A and B
AND C T  # T = A and B and C ie True if no gap in first 3
NOT T T  # T False if no gap in first 3, True if there is a gap
AND T J
AND D J  # J is True if theres is a gap and can land
